### TODO:

Controls:
- raspberry pi serial comms (use CV to move stirrup hoe back and forth)
- integrate stirrup hoe control into robot.ino

CV:
- experiment with anisotropic image morphology kernels - maybe build this as a grid into frontend as well, if I can't hardcode something that works for all cases and need it be a variable for field testing
- quantify uncertainty of driptape regression, so that I can use this as a metric for automatic ideal filter settings selection
